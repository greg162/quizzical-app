## Required Packages

This site was developed on version v10.15.3 of node.

When in development, you'll need to install the following items:

  1) (Nodemon)[https://github.com/remy/nodemon] - Used to watch for file changes in the background and re-run the server. Install this globally.
  2) (Concurrently)[https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently] - Allows Node to run two commands at once and so watch both the server and front end for changes that need re-compiling. Install this globally.
